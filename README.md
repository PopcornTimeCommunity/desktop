This project would absolutely **not** be possible without the original developer's hard work into making Popcorn Time what it is today. All credit should go to them, we're just trying to help the community :)

## Getting Started

If you're comfortable getting up and running from a `git clone`, this method is for you.

If you clone the GitLab repository, you will need to build a number of assets using grunt.

## Versioning

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Popcorn Time will be maintained according to the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>-<build>`

Constructed with the following guidelines:

* A new *major* release indicates a large change where backwards compatibility is broken.
* A new *minor* release indicates a normal change that maintains backwards compatibility.
* A new *patch* release indicates a bugfix or small change which does not affect compatibility.
* A new *build* release indicates this is a pre-release of the version.
